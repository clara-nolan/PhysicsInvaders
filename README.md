Extra Features
- 3 kinds of powerups: ExtraLife, FasterBullet, and SplitBullet
- ExtraLife provides the player an extra life
- FasterBullet increases the bullet speed
- SplitBullet causes another bullet to be spawned

  These powerups can be accessed once the player has killed atleast 3 aliens and once the player has killed another batch of atleast 3 aliens, there is a chance for more powerups to spawn. However, the player must position themselves to be hit by the falling powerup, otherwise it will not activate.
